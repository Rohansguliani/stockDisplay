# stockDisplay
Stock list display website.

The goal of this website is to be a customizable one-stop-shop for viewing and updating stock lists.

In the first version, a user will be able to log in, view his lists, add/remove lists, and add/remove stocks from lists. Prices will be displayed in real time during market hours, and show the closing price after hours through before open the next morning.

In the second version, a user will be able to set alerts for stock prices, in the form of "if stock X hits price Y or (more/less)". Alerts will be through email/text/phone. 

In the third version, a user will be able to hover over and/or click a ticker in a list and a graph display of the stock will show up. This display will be a standard stock graph showing the 1D, 5D, 30D, 3M, 6M, 1Y, 2Y, and 5Y intervals.
