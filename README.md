# stockDisplay
Equity list display website called Equima (Equity Manager)

The goal of this website is to be a customizable one-stop-shop for viewing and updating watch lists.

In the first version, a user will be able to log in, view his lists, add/remove lists, and add/remove equities from lists. Prices will be displayed in real time during market hours, and show the closing price after hours through before open the next morning. Non-market-hour equities will be constantly updated.

In the second version, a user will be able to set alerts for stock prices, in the form of "if equity X hits price Y or (more/less)". Alerts will be through email/text/phone. 

In the third version, a user will be able to hover over and/or click a ticker in a list and a graph display, price history information, information about the equity, and other information will show up. The graph will show the 1D, 5D, 30D, 3M, 6M, 1Y, 2Y, and 5Y intervals.
